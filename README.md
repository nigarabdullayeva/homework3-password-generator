I made a website that generates randomly password.
 
For password generation user have to select any  suggested criteria of password he wants :
      - numbers
       - lowercase 
       - uppercase
        - symbols 

Also website askes user to select a password length ( from 8 to 128)

If the user select less or more than permitted length, then website send alert message.
If the user doesnâ€™t select appropriate criteria, then website send alert message.

When  all criteria confirmed and a password length put, password displayes in the special area.
